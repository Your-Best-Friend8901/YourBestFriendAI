Concept of an AI based on a collective mind.

# Your Best Friend AI

This project is a conceptual idea for a new type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) based on a collective mind. Instead of a single, centralized system, this AI consists of multiple independent agents, each with its own unique role. These agents interact with each other, discuss, and make decisions collaboratively.

## Agents in the system:
- **Logic** — Analyzes data and makes logical conclusions.
- **Empath** — Evaluates emotions and provides emotional support.
- **Dreamer** — Generates creative ideas and solutions.
- **Skeptic** — Questions assumptions and checks for errors.
- **Supportive Friend** — Helps with decision-making and provides comfort in difficult times.

This approach aims to create an AI that is more human-like, capable of thinking and interacting like a group of individuals, leading to more complex and thoughtful outcomes.

## Key Features:
- Emotional support and decision-making assistance.
- Creative idea generation and problem-solving.
- Collaborative reasoning and decision-making process.

This idea is designed to push the boundaries of how AI can assist and interact with people on a deeper level.
